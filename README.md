## Project Overview

This open source project is a continuation of a previous capstoneâ€™s group efforts, which is available on SEG4910CapstoneProject repositories. It is an Automated Cybersecurity Intelligence Reporting System that uses Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) and cybersecurity related feeds to get cybersecurity news and research articles, analyze them, identify threat trends using ML models and assign scores for criticality, relevance and importance to Bell. Important indicators of compromise are mapped to a local database.

We are building a web-based platform that helps security analysts generate cyber threat intelligence reports efficiently. The system aggregates articles from OpenCTI, categorizes them, tracks view metrics, and allows analysts to add contextual statistics and comments. Analysts can preview, save, and manage these reports via an intuitive frontend interface.
