## Project Overview

CyberReport Hub is a web-based platform that helps security analysts generate cyber threat intelligence reports efficiently. The system aggregates articles from OpenCTI, categorizes them, tracks view metrics, and allows analysts to add contextual statistics and comments. Analysts can preview, save, and manage these reports via an intuitive frontend interface.
